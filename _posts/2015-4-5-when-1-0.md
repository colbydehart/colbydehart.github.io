So I'm finally fully ready to announce When V.1.0 is ready! When was my 
first capstone at [Nashville Software School](http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com)
and is a group activity planner. It's powered by Firebase with an Angular frontend and you
can go ahead and log in and use it [here](http://colbydehart.com/when)

Basically the idea is that you login and can create events for groups.
You pick a name and a time range when the event can possibly happen and
the app generates a link. You can send the link to whoever you want to attend.
They put in their name and email and then edit their availability on a calendar
widget. Then you, the creator of the event, can view the merged calendar of 
everyone's availability. In the case where there is no possible way that every
participant can attend the event, the app will sort the participants by busyness
and then find the most optimal number of participants.

Feel free to give it a spin and if you have any issues, you can submit an 
issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/colbydehart/when) or put a comment
below.
