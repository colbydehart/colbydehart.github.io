[Gulp](//gulpjs.com) is a JavaScript task runner. It can automate tasks in your
development environment like running tests, linting code, compiling sass, 
and much, much, more. If all of that doesn't make a ton of sense to you, 
don't worrry. In this post, I plan on outlining how to get Gulp up an running
for someone with no knowledge of task runners or node. 

<span class="more"></span>

### Tasks
In this example environment we are about to set up, we will have Gulp handle
4 tasks for us.

1. Opening a local webserver.
2. Processing our scss files into one `style.css` file.
3. Watching our files for changes and running tasks accordingly.

These are just what I needed for a project I am working on. Gulp is capable of 
many [dozens of tasks](https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=gulp), but for right now we will stick with these. 

### Setup
The first necessary step is to install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) if you have
not already. Their website has good instructions for installation through their
site or a package manager like `brew`. If you are not familiar, Node is basically
the innards of Google Chrome's JavaScript interpreter in a standalone application.
This allows us to write JavaScript programs that can perform console-style tasks
like spinning up servers, parsing files, and editing their output. 

Installing node will automatically install `npm` which stands for 'Node package 
manager'. This program will allow you to install node modules (programs) from
the npm repository. It is very similar to brew, apt-get, or ruby gems if you have
ever used any of these.

After installing node, we need to make a configuration file in our current
project for node. This is one simple command, `npm init`. Running this will
ask a few questions and then output a file in your root directory called 
`package.json`. This file is how Node keeps track of your project and its
dependency modules. If you get a project with a package.json, you can 
install all of its dependencies via `npm install`.

To install a single module with npm, you use the command 
`npm install <options> <package-names>`, where 'package-names' is a 
space-separated list of package names. There are quite a few options you can
pass in, but the 3 that are important in this post are:

- `--global` (or `-g`): will install the module globally so you can use it from
  anywhere, not just in a project.
- `--save` (or `-S`): will save the module only on the current project and add it 
  as a dependency in the `package.json`.
- `--save-dev` (or `-D`): will save the module only on the current project and add
  it to the `package.json`, but as a development dependency.

Since this is our first time installing gulp, we will need to instal it globally
so we can use the `gulp` command from the terminal and also locally on our 
project as a development dependency. So this far, we should have run these commands...

{% highlight bash %}
npm init
#Answer questions for package.json initialization
npm install --global gulp
npm install --save-dev gulp
{% endhighlight %}

That's it as far as getting the basics set up for Node. Now we need to configure 
gulp with our Gulpfile

### Gulpfile
Go ahead and make a file in your root directory called `Gulpfile.js` this is the 
file that gulp uses to configure its tasks. We can make a basic skeleton gulpfile
that will look like this. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
});
{% endhighlight %}

Now if you jump back into your console and run `gulp`, the console should print
out

{% highlight javascript %}
[10:26:12] Using gulpfile ~/myCoolSite/Gulpfile.js
[10:26:12] Starting 'default'...
Gulp is running!
[10:26:12] Finished 'default' after 72 Î¼s
{% endhighlight %}

Awesome! We got Gulp to print out to the console. Now, let's talk about that 
Gulpfile, because there is some Node-specific stuff that might be confusing. So
here in the first line...

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');
{% endhighlight %}

This `require` keyword is a Node method that will import a module. It will look 
in your node_modules folder (which was created when you `npm install`ed gulp) for
the module and put it into the `gulp` variable so that we can use the gulp 
methods in our JavaScript. Using and creating node modules is a pretty deep 
subject, but for now all you need to know is that `require` pulls in a module
that we installed with `npm install`.

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.task('default', function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
});
{% endhighlight %}

This is the way in which gulp will make tasks. The first argument it takes in is
the name of the task we are defining and the second argument is the function
that will run in the task. Here we are just calling a `console.log`. In browsers,
console.log will output to the JavaScript console, but in node it will output
to the terminal. Alright, time to start making this actually useful.

### Webserver
To get our webserver running, we need to first install the module for doing so.
Jump out to your terminal and run `npm install -D gulp-webserver`. This is a 
module that lets us spin up a localhost server from a directory and use livereload
if we want. There are a [multitude](https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=gulp%20server)
of server modules for gulp, but this is a dead simple one and you can always
switch to a different one later. 

Now to get the webserver accessible in our gulp we need to require it, so add the
line `var webserver = require('gulp-webserver');` at the top of your Gulpfile.
note that I called the variable 'webserver' instead of 'gulp-webserver'. This is
a pretty common convention, and also just helps you avoid having to write 'gulp-'
all over the place.

Now change your default gulp task to be...
{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.task('default', function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
  gulp.src('./')
    .pipe(webserver());
});
{% endhighlight %}

So there are a couple new things here, first of all is `gulp.src()`. This is a 
gulp function that will take in one argument, a string, that will be a file or 
directory that can then feed in to other processes. This string can use 
[glob matching](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/Tcl16a.html) so that 
`*.js` will match any .js file and `app/**/*.js` will match any .js in any
folder in the app directory. 

The second new thing is `.pipe` this is a method on the object that `gulp.src`
returns. This will take the files and directories selected in `src` and then
pass or 'pipe' them into a function. We pipe the source (which here `./` is our
root directory) into the webserver function. So the basic gulp work flow looks
like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.src(files)
  .pipe(doStuffWithFiles())
  .pipe(doMoreStuffWithFiles());
{% endhighlight %}

### Sass Processing
Next up is Sass. If you aren't familiar, Sass is a language that looks like CSS
with some added functionality which compiles down into CSS. So go ahead and 
install some more modules with `npm install -D gulp-sass gulp-concat`. 'gulp-sass'
will translate our .scss files into .css and 'gulp-concat' lets us concatenate a 
bunch of files together into one. So we will take all of the .scss files we have
and then smoosh them all together in one `style.css` file.

First make sure you require your new modules in your Gulpfile, so the beginning 
should now look like this. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');
var webserver = require('gulp-webserver');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
{% endhighlight %}

alright, now we need to make a new task for compiling the Sass and then also 
include as part of our default task. This code will look like this.

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.task('sass', function(){
  gulp.src('sass/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .on('error', console.log)
    .pipe(concat('style.css'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.'));
});

gulp.task('default', ['sass'], function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
  gulp.src('./')
    .pipe(webserver());
});
{% endhighlight %}

In the default task, we passed in an array after the first argument. This is
an array of all of the tasks we have previously defined that we need to run
before we run the task we are currently defining.  In this case, gulp will 
run the task `sass` and create our stylesheet before running the default task
and loading the server.

So in the sass task, after we pipe all of our .scss files (`sass/*.scss` as long
as you are storing your .scss files in a directory called 'sass') we handle errors
by passing any possible errors from the `sass` process into console.log so that we
can see them. Then we pipe that into the concat function which takes one argument,
the name of the file that the concatenated files should have. So our new file will
be called `style.css`. 

After this, we see a new function, `gulp.dest()`. This function is
the yin to gulp.src's yang. It will take all of the files from source, 
now modified by whatever they have been piped into, into a destination folder, in
this case, our root folder.  Now we are getting somewhere, but still have one more
task to implement.

### Watching Files
Watching files for changes and then running tasks is a key feature of a task 
runner, and it could not be simpler with gulp. We don't even need a new module
for this one, gulp includes its own watch method. All we have to do is add a
single line to our default task.

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.task('default', ['sass'], function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
  gulp.src('./')
    .pipe(webserver());
  gulp.watch('sass/*.scss', ['sass'] )
});
{% endhighlight %}

After our webserver, we call `gulp.watch`. The first argument here is a file glob
like in our gulp.src call, and the second argument is an array of tasks to run
when any of the files in the first argument change. So any time an .scss file in
our sass directory gets changed, gulp will automatically render it to css, it's
pretty neat. So now our final gulpfile looks like this. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');
var webserver = require('gulp-webserver');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');


gulp.task('sass', function(){
  gulp.src('sass/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .on('error', console.log)
    .pipe(concat('style.css'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.'));
});

gulp.task('default', ['sass'], function(){
  console.log("Gulp is running!");
  gulp.src('./')
    .pipe(webserver());
  gulp.watch('sass/*.scss', ['sass'] );
});
{% endhighlight %}

From here there are 
[limitless ways](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/recipes) to use 
Gulp to make your life easier. It can compile coffeescript, lint your code, 
minify, prettify, optimize images, run test suites and probably 100 other things.
And if there is something that you want to do that isn't available, you can always
build it.
